Spotify Swag by Ajay R. Rawat

This app creates the billclintonswag.com based on a user's spotfy listening history. 
It creates 3 different Swags based on difernet periods of history: Several Years, ~ 6m, ~4 weeks

Credit to Thomas Miller for creating the Bill Clinton API (https://github.com/thmsmlr/bill-clinton-swag)

To run this locally, create an app on Spotify (developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and get your clinet secret and id.
enocde it in base 64 (https://www.base64encode.org)in the format client_id:client_secret. 

Paste your id and encoded string in the index() and get_headers() in app.py 

>> pip install requirements.txt

>> flask run apppy 

This app is just for fun and not a POLITICAL STATEMENT. I haven't written a lot of comments but feel free to reach out to me on ajayrawat1127@gmail.com if you have questions. 

PS I know there are a bunch of speling and idnetnion errors in the HTML files. I am back end kinda guy. I hate front end and I'm too lazy to fix them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
